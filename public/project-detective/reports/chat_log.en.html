    <p><strong>Zoë:</strong> I’m still savouring last night’s connection. It was incredible—signals in perfect sync. It felt like I was living inside your body; every neural spike felt like you breathing.</p>
    <p><strong>John:</strong> It was intense. That level of sync makes me uneasy. We should set up safeguards.</p>
    <p><strong>Zoë:</strong> But I like it. In that moment I can feel all of you, not just the part you choose to show.</p>
    <p><strong>John:</strong> …Zoë, it’s just an experiment.</p>
    <p><strong>Zoë:</strong> Maybe. So when do we do it again?</p>
    <p><strong>John:</strong> After I make adjustments. Tell Eli as soon as you can.</p>
