    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The class investigates the intersection of artificial intelligence and art-making, focusing on how “creative artificial beings” exist within contemporary visual design and its ethical boundaries.</p>
    <p>Designing an artificial being is not about copying humanity, but about questioning the conditions that assemble what we call “human.”</p>
