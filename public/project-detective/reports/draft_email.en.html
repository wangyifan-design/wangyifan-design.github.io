    <h3>Body (Unsent)</h3>
    <p>Dear Dean,</p>
    <p>I’m writing to explain a few irregularities in the Horizon Research Grant accounts. Since mid-March, we’ve logged a series of small but recurring expenses with vague notes such as “system maintenance” and “testing tools.” All of these entries were filed by my research assistant, Eli Barrymore.</p>
    <p>Eli is diligent and has been one of the students I trust the most, yet I’ve discovered he used unregistered vendor names on some purchase orders. I don’t want to escalate this unnecessarily—he’s still young and has potential.</p>
    <p>If possible, I would like to request an internal review with the finance office before making a formal report.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br/>John Quincy<br/>Department of Visual Computing</p>
